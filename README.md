# What is PrintShop?
An Open-Source Website &amp; API to help Artist automate their "scan-to-ship" workflow, written in Go!

## Example Workflow
1. Scan in a piece of work
2. Printshop Auto-Uploads to its File System (with backups)
3. You access a private website where you can check which images should go live (& set pricing, name, and printer ink checks)
4. Live prints are automatically posted to your public online store. 
5. When someone checks out on your website - PrintShop sends a print job to your printer + generates a shipping label.
6. *take the print to the post and call it a day*
